## Overview
The **Store Management Application** is a desktop-based application developed during my 5th semester as part of the **Software Construction and Development (SCD)** course. This project was created using **Java Swing** for the frontend and follows a **client-server architecture** for the backend, implemented in **Java**. The application provides a streamlined way to manage store operations through a **role-based system**, ensuring data security and functionality based on user roles.
